# üìå AI-Powered Missing Person and Criminal Identification & Police Alert System

## üîç Overview
This cutting-edge platform uses **real-time facial recognition technology** to identify missing persons and criminal suspects from video feeds across multiple locations. When a match is found, the system immediately alerts relevant authorities via SMS, potentially saving crucial time in locating individuals of interest.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced Facial Recognition** - Deep learning algorithms identify individuals by comparing video feed faces against our secure database
- **Multi-Location Monitoring** - Process simultaneous video streams from various locations for comprehensive coverage
- **Instant SMS Notifications** - Location-specific alerts sent to authorities when matches are detected via Twilio API
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed records of all detections including images, timestamps, and location data
- **Secure Admin Dashboard** - Protected interface for system management, record updates, and detection monitoring
- **Centralized Database** - Secure storage for facial encodings, personal information, and all system activities
